# Simple Game Server

A learning project making a game server in C from scratch, data structures
included. The server was not completed, and won't currently build. I was working
very fast and loose, and the build system is simply shell scripts.

The data structures are the most interesting and complete part of this repo.
The corresponding benchmarks and "tests" should all build and work.

This project moved to [Zig][1] and became the Zig game server [thierd][2].
